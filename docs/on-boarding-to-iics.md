# On-Boarding to IICS

## On-Boarding Discussion

In order to get access to Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS), please [email the DoIT Integration Platform Team](mailto:doit-integration-platform@office365.wisc.edu).
We set up a meeting to start the on-boarding process.
As part of this process, we'll be interested in learning about the following topics:

- What is your use case? What integration(s) are you wanting to have implemented, and what business need are you trying to satisfy?
- Are there any timelines you need to follow? Are there any deadlines we should know about?
- Will you be using a shared org, or will you require a sub-org? For more information on this question, please see [this document](./shared-org-vs-sub-org.md).
- A Secure Agent is required to run integrations. Are you able to manage you own secure agent, or do you need the Integration Platform to provide one for you? See [this document](./best-practices/secure-agent.md) for more information on Secure Agents.

## Next Steps

After the initial on-boarding discussion, the Integration Platform team will work with you to give you access to IICS.
Access is controlled through Manifest.
See [this document](./howto.md#how-to-create-a-manifest-group-for-your-team-for-access-control) for more information.
We will also work on setting up any additional connectors, sub-orgs, or secure agent licenses, if applicable to your use-case.

After getting access to IICS, you can start [training](./training.md), follow [tutorials](./tutorials.md), and start implementing your integration(s).
Informatica also provides documentation to get started (e.g. [getting started guide for Cloud Application Integration (CAI)](https://network.informatica.com/docs/DOC-17653)).

## Other Integration Options

The Integration Platform team can also help facilitiate other options to build your integration.
Our team can connect you with professional services or discuss the availability for our team to implement and manage your integration.
Please let us know in your email if either of these options are something you want to proceed with.
