# Informatica Integration Cloud Services
Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS) is a platform that enables data integration between systems and 
applications, including on-premise-to-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-on-premise.  IICS belongs to a class of 
products called “Integration Platform as a Service” (iPaaS).

Here are some examples of where IICS can be used:
* Syncing data from PersonHub to a third-party cloud service on a nightly basis.
* Processing changes from CAOS in real time to update an on-premises system.
* Extracting data from a third-party cloud service to populate a reporting database.

The platform caters to a diverse technical audience including those who may have very little integration experience and 
to those who have advanced development and integration skills.

## Benefits
* Create integrations that move data in real time or on a scheduled basis.
* Pre-built connectors enable reusable integrations to a variety of other services (e.g. Salesforce, Oracle, AWS S3).
* Allows integration of on-premises systems, databases, and cloud-based software as a service (SaaS).
* Design and implement integrations in a web browser using no-code and low-code tools. 
* Run integrations in the cloud or deploy them to your own infrastructure.
